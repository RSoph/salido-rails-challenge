Conundrum Red Blend opens up with aromas of dark fruit, plums, and rich berries that are layered with a subtle smokiness.  The wine has a round, full-bodied entry onto the palate with supple fruit and brown spice, and leaves with a strong yet nuanced final impression of subtle sweetness.\r\n</li>\r\n<li><b>Caymus Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon</b><br>\r\nCaymus Vineyards was established in 1972 when a mother and father and their son embarked on a family winery.  From the onset, they concentrated on the production of Cabernet Sauvignon, which produces the most superlative wine in the Napa Valley region. Often considered \"trendsetters\" in the style of Napa Valley Cabernet, Caymus has continued to forge new techniques in both vineyards and winery.

Louis XIV became known as the \"Sun King\" for his benevolence and his patronage of the Arts, which became the foundation of France's rich artistic heritage. At the Palace of Versailles Louis XIV was the first French King to drink Champagne.<p>Louis XIV's era became known as the Grand SiÃ¨cle - the \"Great Century\". Bottled in a replica of a 17th Century bottle evoking the radiance of that period, Laurent-Perrier's prestige cuvÃ©es embody luxury, magnificence and elegance fit for a king.<p>When it came to his prestige cuvÃ©e, Bernard de Nonancourt decided to highlight two of Champagne's traditional realms of proficiency: the blending of different crus and different vintages. Grand SiÃ¨cle is the epitome of Champagne cuvÃ©es, as it blends complementary wines from Laurent-Perrier's very best growths and most successful vintage years.<p>Grand SiÃ¨cle is made with a pinot noir and chardonnay blend, with the latter being slightly dominant. Twelve of the most prestigious villages supply these grapes; all of them classified at 100% Grands Crus such as Ambonnay, Verzenay, Mailly, Avize, Cramant, Chouilly and Le Mesnil-sur-Oger. Within the vineyards of these villages, only the very best plots are selected, as are the finest musts from the pressings. The blended wine is then aged during the second fermentation on the yeast for approximately five years.<p>It has a bright color, with a brilliant yellow hue. Its subtle aromas of honey, hazelnuts, grilled almonds and brioche, make this the perfect companion for refined dishes. It pairs just as well with poultry and truffles as it does with veal and morel mushrooms."], ["community_rating", 0]]
